# Big Brother Research
A computer program for performing data analysis on the effects of racial and ethnic match on mentor-mentee relationships in the Big Brother/Big Sister organization. Done in support of Jennifer Koide's PhD research thesis "Effects of Ethnicâ€“Racial Identity on Strength of Mentorship Relationships."

## Use:

- Order a SOR (Strength of Relationship) data sheet first by "Match ID" alphabetically and then by Completion Date (from earliest date to latest)
- Order a Match History Detail date sheet by "Match ID" alphabetically.
- Run the program in a R notebook. You will be prompted several separate times:
  - First, to enter the pathway of the SOR file:

  - Second, to enter the pathway of the Match History file:
  
  /Users/thomashefele/Desktop/Research/Jen's Research/BBBS2.png
  
  - Lastly, to enter the time interval of interest for comparison of survey scores to the baseline (+/- a user-stated deviation):

  Afterwards, your work is done! The program will now sift through the data to produce a file of all cases with completed surveys at both the baseline and the target time interval.
